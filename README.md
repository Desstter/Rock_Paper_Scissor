# Getting Started with Create React App

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!

In this game, you will play against the computer. The game follows the traditional rules of rock paper scissors:

Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)
Scissors beat paper (scissors cut paper)
Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)
If you and the computer choose the same option, the game is a tie.

To play the game, simply select one of the three options by clicking the corresponding button. The computer will make its selection, and the result of the game will be displayed. The score will be updated accordingly.

Good luck and have fun!
